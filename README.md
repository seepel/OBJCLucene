## OBJCLucene

OBJCLucene is an Objective-C wrapper for CLucene.  It's meant to be lightweight and leverage CLucene as much as possible without having to resort to include Objective-C++ in your project.

Currently what's implemented is the bare minimum that I needed for my project, but ideally overtime this will expand to include more API's and features of CLucene.

It's only been tested and compiled with the iOS 7 SDK, with a iOS 5 Target.  It should build just fine for OS X however.
